forEach Lab
---

## Objectives

1. Practice using `forEach`
2. Practice passing functions as callbacks

## Instructions

You'll be editing `forEach.js` and running tests as usual.

- Define a function, `iterativeLog`, that accepts an array. Call `.forEach()` on this array, and inside the callback, log each element with the format `${index}: ${element}!`.
- Define a function, `iterate`, that accepts a callback. Within the `iterate` function, you should initialize an array â€” it can contain anything you want. Call `.forEach()` on this array, passing the callback to `.forEach()`. Then return the array that you initialized.
- Define a function, `doToArray` that accepts an array and a callback. Call `.forEach()` on the array, passing the callback as the `forEach` callback.
